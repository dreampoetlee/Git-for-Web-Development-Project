        Add your TL as collaborator

        on GitHub:
        Settings -> Collaborators -> Add Collaborator (use your TL's handle)
        (I'd suggest grabbing the invite tag and DM it to your TL on Slack at this point)

        Clone YOUR Repo

        back on your machine:
        git clone <your-repo-address>

        Create a branch (the one you are going to be working on)

        cd <repo directory>
        git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'

        Push your new branch up to GitHub and make all future pushes to that branch

        git push -u origin firstname-lastname

        on GitHub:
        Compare & Pull Request -> Base: YOUR MASTER (Not the Lambda Master)
        compare fork: YOUR FORK

        Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull Request

        On the 'Open a Pull Request' page click on Reviewers. If your TL has accepted your invite, then you should be able to select them here. If not, then they haven't accepted the invite, and come back later...

        Your TL will merge the work into YOUR Master fork when they have reviewed and approved it.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

      - With a block-level element, there will always be a new line after the closing tag
      - With an inline element, there is never a new line after the closing tag

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

      - An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on  its own layer seperate from everything else.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

      - You would utilzie the CSS box model and adjust the width and padding properties

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

      - block elements: <div>, <p>, <ul>
      - inline elements: <span>, <img>, <a>
      - inline-block element: <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

      - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element and consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The fix for the box model is to use box-sizing: border-box to you code.
